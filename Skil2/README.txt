Open github: https://github.com/maggawaage/skil2/tree/master/Skil2

Username = Dabs

URL link:
Use Github location in interface: By pressing 7 user's computers should open URL link to our github file. 
This works for Windows and Mac users, but authors are not sure if it works in Linux as they didn't have a Linux computer to test it on.

To connect to the Db.sqlite, Mac users need to have a full path in QT file. Windows and Linux users don't need full path. 
To get a hint for password you will have to enter 3 times a wrong username or password. It will then give you the option of a hint.
The hint is a ascii art of Daníel Brandur.

Search function:
Users are able to search for one ore more arguments instead of only searching for one thing at a time. 

We use system(CLEAR); to clear the window only to make things more organised.
The program has a check to see if the user is using Mac or a Windows computer to change CLEAR to "cls" if the user is running Windows.
